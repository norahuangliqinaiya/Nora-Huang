# RSA

Code for the representational similarity analysis, accompanying the paper:

Li, L., Espina, E., Bond, M. H., Lun, V. M. C., Huang, L., Duan, Q., & Liu, J. H. (2021). Individual uniqueness in trust profiles and well-being: Understanding the role of cultural tightness-looseness from a representation similarity perspective.

This repository contains the main steps of analysis of the show case in the manuscript, as a brief introduction about the application of RSA in cross-cultural analysis. 
Detailed description please see the comments in the scripts. 

To make sure the script run without error, you need to download all the scripts and data and save them in the same file. Recommend saving the file at C:\RSA.

Pipline:
1. Run the script of 'generate_sim_data.R' to generate the simulated scores for items of trust;
2. Run the script of 'RSA_analysis.R' to conduct the main steps of analysis;
3. Run the script of 'RSA_figures.R' to plot figures;
